#Introduction
We present canvas paintings inspired by nature.

- You can use cotton, or different canvas material depending on the colour 
types you use (Stylianou et al 2023).

Stylianou et al (2023) refers to different type of colours
You can use acrylic, oil or even water colour. However water colours are 
not recommended for canvas. 

#Simulations
We observe the evolution of painting techniques and how they changed 
through years.

#Methodolofy

- The Picasso technique: Picasso used drypoint combined with original 
print-making techniques, usually to produce lines of simplicity and 
expressive quality (Picasso, 1881)

-da Vinci applied very thin, nearly transparent layers of oil paint with 
his fingers over many months to slowly build up the glowing, softly 
focused image of Mona Lisa.
